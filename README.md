#Â tcp-chat

This is a *super* basic TCP server that anyone can connect to without implementing any sophisticated protocols or commands:

  * When the server is connected, it greets you and asks for you name. It tells you how many other clients are connected.
  * Upon typing in your name followed by Enter, you're considered connected.
  * When connected, you can receive and send messages to other connected clients by typing and pressing Enter.


## Usage instructions

Run this code to spawn your TCP to the server:

    $ node server.js

When ***listen*** executes, it binds the server to the port ***3000*** and subsenquetly prints a message to the server terminal. An important method is ***listen***, which allows you to *bind the server to a port*. Because this method is *asynchronous*, it also receives a *callback*.

Whithin several terminals run this code to attemp a connection with ***telnet***:

    $ telnet 127.0.0.1 3000

If that connection goes as expected, you will see the command and the *"new connection!"* output side by side.

To kill one terminal you could run:

    $ ps aux | grep telnet
    $ kill -9 <telnet-pid>
